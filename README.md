# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, with both single-player (against a computer) and multiplayer modes. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging game for the player.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against a computer AI that uses the Minimax algorithm for strategic moves.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Play against another human player.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Easy-to-use console-based gameplay.
- **Board Display**: The current state of the game board is displayed after every move.
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai
   \`\`\`

2. Run the game:

   \`\`\`bash
   python bootcamp_AI.ipynb
   \`\`\`

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

- **Single-Player**: Choose the single-player mode to play against the computer. You will play as 'X', and the computer will play as 'O'.
- **Multiplayer**: Choose the multiplayer mode to play against another human player. The first player will be 'X', and the second player will be 'O'.

The game will prompt you to enter a position (1-9) to place your marker on the board. The positions correspond to the following layout:

\`\`\`
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
